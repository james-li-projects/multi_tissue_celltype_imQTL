# GitHub repository for the manuscript entitled: "Mapping the landscape of cell type-dependent genetic regulation of DNA methylation across human tissues"

## Description: 
_**master_imQTL.Rmd**_ is a master file that details all of the steps performed in this project to map cell type-interaction mQTLs (imQTLs) and conduct downstream analyses. Within this master file, the commands to call scripts are detailed. These scripts are located in folders named _**./python**_, _**./rscripts**_, and _**./sbatch**_, which correspond to the respective file type of each script.
